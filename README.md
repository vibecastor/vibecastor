I'm a full-stack engineer passionate about building meaningful tools that help people connect, learn, and grow.

- âš¡ Fun facts: I currently live in Seattle, WA, I love mountains, music and coffee! Iâ€™ve led recruiting teams at Meta and founded a startup that blends psychology with tech. The handle @vibecastor is a play on the fact that I play a musical instrument called the vibraphone.
